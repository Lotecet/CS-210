•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    o	My project 3 was trying to create a UI for the user to give them an option to select different ways to read a .txt file. The program read the file and backed up the data with the inventory and quantity in a .dat file. Then it would print the different views for the user. It would also do a search for an inventory item.
•	What did you do particularly well?
    o	I think I was able to add errors cleanly to the inventory search option catching errors that if there were numbers in the searched name or catching errors if the item was not found.
•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    o	I could have added a feature to re-read the file so that it would always refresh with updated information throughout the day. Another thing was I could have separated the read and write class functions instead of combining them into one for better a better         Object Oriented Program.
•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    o	I found it difficult to write the part using maps to read the file. I had just learned it that week and I was already implementing it into a major project. I overcame this by constantly referring back to the workbook to see what I needed to fix. It would be        great if I could keep the zybooks activities so I can always reference them in the future.
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    o	I think just refreshing this language in general is good for me to learn. It has been over 10 years since I last used this language and I was not feeling very confident starting off this class.
•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    o	I made it maintainable by already adding the constructor if the files every change. They would just need to adjust the program to get some input so that the program can pass the updated files. I also added inline comments so that the next programmer will           hopefully have an easy enough time finding a good place to added the input for the new files. This program was also built around the files so they could just add a new part to the class for the input and have the main program reference their new section of code      so it would be easier testing.
